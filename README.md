# Movie-Reviews-Webpage

**Project Objective:**

The primary objective of this project is to develop a web page that empowers users to search for movies by their titles and explore reviews related to those movies.

**Project Workflow:**

1. **Movie Search:** Users will have the ability to enter the title of a movie they are interested in within a designated input field.

2. **API Interaction:** Upon entering the movie title and clicking the search button, the application will initiate an API request. This request is directed towards The Movie Database API, which processes the query and responds with a list of top matches that closely match the entered movie title.

3. **Response Handling:** Once the API response is received, the application dynamically extracts and displays movie reviews. These reviews are showcased in an interactive carousel format.

4. **Carousel Implementation:** To achieve this carousel display of reviews, the project employs the `react-slick` library. This library offers a set of tools and components to efficiently create and manage carousels within a React-based web application.

In essence, this project revolves around the creation of a user-friendly web page that enables movie searches by title and offers a seamless experience for exploring movie reviews. It leverages The Movie Database API for data retrieval and implements the `react-slick` library to present movie reviews in a visually appealing carousel format.
